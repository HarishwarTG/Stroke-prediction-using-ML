**Introduction**
Stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease characterized by an interruption of blood flow to the brain, leading to a critical condition where brain cells begin to die due to lack of oxygen and nutrients. According to the American Stroke Association, stroke ranks as the fifth leading cause of death and disability in the United States. As such, it has been the focus of extensive research, including studies in data science and machine learning.

**Dataset Description**
This project utilizes a dataset comprising 5110 patient records, with each record containing 12 attributes related to medical history and clinical trials. Key attributes include hypertension, heart diseases, average glucose levels, and body mass index (BMI), all of which are significant indicators of stroke risk. Additionally, the dataset includes information on whether each patient has experienced a stroke event or not.

**Data Dictionary**
Id: Unique identifier for each patient.
Gender: Gender of the patient.
Age: Age of the patient.
Hypertension: Binary feature indicating presence of hypertension.
Heart_disease: Binary feature indicating presence of heart disease.
Ever_married: Indicates whether the patient has ever been married.
Work_type: Work type of the patient.
Residency_type: Type of residency of the patient.
Avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in the patient's blood.
BMI: Body mass index of the patient.
Smoking_status: Smoking status of the patient.
Stroke: Binary feature indicating occurrence of a stroke event.

**Project Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on their medical history and demographic information.

**Methodology**
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

**Data Preprocessing:** 
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
Exploring relationships between variables and identifying patterns.
**Feature Engineering:** 
Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.
**Model Selection:** 
Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model.
**Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the chosen model using appropriate metrics.
**Deployment:** Deploying the model for real-world use, such as in healthcare settings, to assist in stroke risk assessment.

*Conclusion*
By leveraging machine learning techniques on a comprehensive dataset, this project aims to contribute to stroke prevention efforts by providing a reliable means of identifying individuals at higher risk of experiencing a stroke. Through accurate prediction and early intervention, it is possible to reduce the incidence and impact of this debilitating disease.
